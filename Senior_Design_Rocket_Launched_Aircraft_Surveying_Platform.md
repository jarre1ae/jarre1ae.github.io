## Senior Design: Rocket Launched Aircraft Surveying Platform
Long range aerial surveillance has become increasingly important in the past few years, especially with recent conflicts around the globe. An in-depth analysis was conducted to assess the advantages between traditional quadcopters and a rocket launched remotely controlled aircraft equipped with data-collecting systems, such as cameras and environmental sensors. Safety, financial viability, and logistical considerations took precedence in this assessment. Combining the vertical launch capabilities of a rocket with the versatility of remotely controlled flight has the potential to transform the aerospace domain, opening avenues for applications in surveillance, research, and defense. This evaluation serves as a blueprint for the development and manufacturing of a rocket-launched, remote-controlled aircraft.
