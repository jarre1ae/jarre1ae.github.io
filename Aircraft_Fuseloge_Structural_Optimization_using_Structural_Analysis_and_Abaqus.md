## Aircraft Fuseloge Structural Optimization using Structural Analysis and Abaqus
In this study, Abaqus was used to create a model of a fuselage and analyze its behavior under 
various conditions. The problem being addressed was the need to optimize the fuselage for weight 
while ensuring that it meets requirements for deflection and stress. Abaqus was chosen for its range 
of features and capabilities for modeling and simulating complex structures. The modeling process 
included creating the geometry, defining material properties, and specifying external loads and 
constraints. The model was optimized for weight and the 3 lowest natural frequencies were found. 
The emergency impact scenario was simulated, and the FEA equations were solved using solvers 
in Abaqus. Assumptions and simplifications were made, and challenges and difficulties were 
addressed. The results showed improvements to the model and provided data on natural 
frequencies and behavior under the emergency impact scenario. The use of Abaqus was successful 
and provided valuable insights.
