## Senior Design: Rocket Launched Aircraft Surveying Platform
Long range aerial surveillance has become increasingly important in the past few years, especially with recent conflicts around the globe. An in-depth analysis was conducted to assess the advantages between traditional quadcopters and a rocket launched remotely controlled aircraft equipped with data-collecting systems, such as cameras and environmental sensors. Safety, financial viability, and logistical considerations took precedence in this assessment. Combining the vertical launch capabilities of a rocket with the versatility of remotely controlled flight has the potential to transform the aerospace domain, opening avenues for applications in surveillance, research, and defense. This evaluation serves as a blueprint for the development and manufacturing of a rocket-launched, remote-controlled aircraft.

## Duck, Goose, and Duckling Aircraft Design
This project, conducted by Alexander Jarrett and fellow project members at Western Michigan University, focuses on the conceptual design of a versatile amphibian aircraft capable of passenger, cargo, and economic missions. Named "Duck" for passenger missions, "Goose" for cargo, and "Duckling" for economic missions, this aircraft design aims to achieve short takeoff and landing capabilities on various surfaces including land and water.

## Owl-Inspired Flight: Exploring the Aerodynamic Efficiency of Stationary and Sinusoidally Pitching Airfoil Designs
Unsteady aerodynamics is vital in understanding airfoils under varying conditions, especially in biological flight. This study focuses on the owl wing, known for silent flight and maneuverability, to explore its aerodynamics. We analyze unsteady lift using thin-airfoil theory, comparing stationary and sinusoidally pitching owl airfoils. Objectives include plotting the airfoil, calculating lift coefficients at various angles and time instances, and contrasting performance in stationary and dynamic conditions. This research provides insights into owl wing dynamics and contributes to bio-inspired aerospace design.
